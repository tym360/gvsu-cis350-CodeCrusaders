# Code Crusaders

Lingo-Legends, where all players are welcome. This game similar to the game of wordle, gives users the oppurtnity to guess a 5-6 letter word
one chatacter at a time. The user gets 3 attempts to begin and they can lose an attemp per character guessed incorrectly. This game is being created 
for local means only, with the hope of adding multiplayer server based gameplay in the future. If the user clears 3 sets of boards in a row the words get progressivly harder and harder. The dictionary involved in the game will be based on categories to allow for a larger range of words avalible.
